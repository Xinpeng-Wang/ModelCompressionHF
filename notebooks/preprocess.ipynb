Stereotyped behaviors: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking. Compulsive behaviors: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce the anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or handwashing.

Self-injury: Behaviors such as eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting and head-banging.No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.Other symptomsAutistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants.\\n',\n",

       " 'When Achilles instantly took up the spear, Odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the Greek campaign.\\n',\n",
       " \"In another version of the story, Odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women.\\n\",\n",
       " 'While the women fled in panic, Achilles prepared to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.In the Trojan WarAccording to the Iliad, Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 Myrmidons.\\n',\n",
       " 'He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon.TelephusWhen the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in Mysia, ruled by King Telephus.\\n',\n",
       " 'In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that \"he that wounded shall heal\".\\n',\n",
       " \"Guided by the oracle, he arrived at Argos, where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.According to other reports in Euripides' lost play about Telephus, he went to Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.TroilusAccording to the Cypria (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' wrath), when the Achaeans desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas, sacked neighbouring cities (like Pedasus and Lyrnessus, where the Greeks capture the queen Briseis) and killed Tenes, a son of Apollo, as well as Priam's son Troilus in the sanctuary of Apollo Thymbraios; however, the romance between Troilus and Chryseis described in Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde and in William Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida is a medieval invention.In Dares Phrygius' Account of the Destruction of Troy, the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, as well as in older accounts, Troilus was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King Priam's and Hecuba's five legitimate sons (or according other sources, another son of Apollo).\\n\",\n",
       " 'Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders, a \"horse fighter\" or \"chariot fighter\" according to Homer.\\n',\n",
       " \"Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena, and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth\\xa0– who, refusing to yield, instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo Thymbraios.\\n',\n",
       " \"Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace.\\n\",\n",
       " \"In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents.\\n',\n",
       " \"Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the First Vatican Mythographer claimed, Troy would have been invincible; however, the motif is older and found already in Plautus' Bacchides.In the IliadHomer's Iliad is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Achilles' wrath (μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως, mênis Achilléōs) is the central theme of the poem.\\n\",\n",
       " \"The first two lines of the Iliad read:The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles' death.\\n\",\n",
       " \"It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by Agamemnon, the commander of the Achaean forces.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Agamemnon has taken a woman named Chryseis as his slave.\\n',\n",
